_Folder Notes_ allow you to leverage your existing folder structure. You can turn a note into a folder note by adding the following to your frontmatter:

```yaml
---
BC-folder-note-field: "<field>"
---
```

Where `<field>` is one of your [[Edge Fields]]. Breadcrumbs will add edges from the current note to all _other_ notes in the same folder, using the field you specify. For example, the following metadata tells Breadcrumbs to point `down` to all _other_ notes in the current folder:

```yaml
---
BC-folder-note-field: "down"
---
```

```mermaid
flowchart TD
	1(folder/index) -- down --> 2(folder/A) & 3(folder/B)
```

## `BC-folder-note-recurse`

By default, Breadcrumbs will only add edges to notes in the _immediate_ folder. If you want to add edges to notes in _all_ subfolders, you can add the `BC-folder-note-recurse` field to the frontmatter of the folder note.

```yaml
---
BC-folder-note-field: "down"
BC-folder-note-recurse: true
---
```

```mermaid
flowchart TD
	1(folder/index) -- down --> 2(folder/A) & 3(folder/B) & 4(folder/subfolder/a)
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This doesn't create _nested_ edges. It effectively flattens your folder structure into one level, so notes in subfolders will still be added as children of the _top-level_ folder note, not as children of the notes in the subfolders.
